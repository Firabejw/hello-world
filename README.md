Initial repository for learning how to use GitHub

Hello everyone!

My name is Jordan Firaben, and I am currently learning to work with GitHub. I've heard it mentioned throughout the years but never actually sat down and tried to learn how to use it. I'm a student and this seems to be a great way to store the code I'll be working on throughout my studies...
